  How to Update Project Tables
  1) Turn the table header into a link to the specific project Playground.
  2) Replace "Project Missing" with an inline image of the Playground QR Code.
    2.1) The path to the image should be at the same level as the README.
    2.2) The name of the image should be structured like NameOfProject_JS.
         Where "NameOfProject" is the Captialized, collapsed project name.
         And "_JS" means its the JavaScript implementation.
