### Description
<!-- Describe the project. -->
Imitates the iOS cover art animation where an album cover grows and shows a shadow. With the shadow color being the average color of the cover image.

### Related Resources
<!--
Reference any related resources here. These could include;
 * Existing video or blog tutorials that create the same project, or inspired it.
 * A live website or app using the behaviour, style, etc.., the app is trying to replicate.
 * Or perhaps a design from somewhere like dribbble.com inspired the project.

Inspired by _Alexander Ziskinds'_ YouTube tutorial [How to Create iOS Podcast Cover Art Animation with Inheriting Shadow Color](https://youtu.be/CVZDURL8HWs). However here we are not sharing the shadow color with anything else, the shadow has been implemented with fewer components, and the animation has been implemented with [CATransaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/catransaction) instead of the NativeScript animation.
