# NativeScript Play Pit
A growing collection of NativeScript playground projects demonstrating all the _AWESOMENESS_:metal: of NativeScript.

To view a project on your device you'll need the _Playground_ and _Preview_ apps. Once you have the apps you can tap a project link from you phones' browser and it will open in the _Preview_ app. Or you can navigate to the Playground from your computer and select `QR Code` from the UI. Then use the _Playground_ app to scan the QR Code.
